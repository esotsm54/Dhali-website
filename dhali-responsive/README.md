# README

Hey there! Sorry it took a bit longer than expected, but I've been swamped these past few weeks. 

I've set up everything from scratch to make sure you won't have issues loading the page with external libraries. Here's a rundown of what's included:

## CSS classes

I made some CSS classes to handle column layouts for both desktop and mobile. For mobile, these columns will stack nicely one on top of the other. Keep in mind, I might've missed a few minor things like padding.

Here's the list of classes:

- `col-10`
- `col-7`
- `col-6`
- `col-5`
- `col-4`
- `col-3`

Each represents the percentage of the row - so `col-10` would be 100%, `col-7` would be 70%, and so on.

## Menu Function

Added in a simple function to show or hide the menu. Quick and efficient.

Pretty much, this is a good starting point for you. If you have any questions or run into any issues, just let me know. Thanks!
